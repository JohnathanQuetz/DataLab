Existing code in the form of libraries is incredibly useful and a powerful aspect of  
world have created and published libraries to perform countless tasks. One such  library, which you will be using in this activity and the one that follows, is the Sinbad  library. This library allows you to create a Java program that can connect to a data  source, read in data, and then process this data. The goal of this activity is to provide  practice working with the Sinbad library. Before beginning, ensure that you have set  up your IDE appropriately based on instructions from your teacher.  
Run the main method in the Welcome01 class and provide the location and  temperature that are printed.  

Go to the following link,  
the state or territory from the drop-down box shown here.  
From the resulting list, choose a four-character code and modify the main method in  Welcome01 to pull information from this location instead. Provide the four-character  code here.  KSJC
Then write what is displayed when running your main method with this new code.  

Share your results with a partner.

In order to manage large amounts of data or complex relationships in data, it  is helpful to group the data together in such a way using a single variable  that refers to a location capable of storing multiple items rather than a single

In addition to parameters and local variables declared in a method, a method  always has access to any instance variables that are declared within the  enclosing class. These instance variables are often required to complete the
